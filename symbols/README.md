SYMBOLS
=======

If symbol publication is activated in Numishare for coin type collections, symbols will be uploaded to {absolute_path}/symbols declared in the collection config.xml. In order for the XForms application to successfully upload files to this directory, write permissions must be set, e.g.

`chown -R tomcat7:tomcat7 {absolute_path}/symbols`
